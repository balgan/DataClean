# DataClean
Week4 - Coursera Data Cleaning Project

The project for [Getting and Cleaning Data](https://www.coursera.org/course/getdata) involved downloading, and using the data found in ["Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones), to perform an analysis on the data set, and output a tidy data set.

**Here are the steps that must be performed before running the R script:**

1. Clone this repo
2. Run run_analysis.R - all directories are pre configured

**As an artifact of the run_analysis.R script you will get a file named, [tidy-dataset.csv](tidy-dataset.csv).**

You can read more about the data and the analysis in the [code book](CodeBook.md).
